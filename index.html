1849. Revolt in Venice. On the wave of bourgeois revolutions in the Austrian Empire, the Venetians proclaimed independence. The city was besieged. Artillery work was not effective because of the relief and good fortifications on the approaches to Venice.Franz von Juchatik, a lieutenant in the Austrian artillery, came up with the idea of bombing the city from balloons. On July 12, 1849, the first two balloons with bombs were launched on the besieged city. On board were bombs with shrapnel, as well as mechanisms for dropping them at the right moment. The bombardment did not yield significant results, but created panic among the Venetians.

This case is considered the first documented evidence of the use of drones in history.
Wartime is a time of active use of new technologies and innovative developments in various branches of science and technology.</p>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<p>1910. Inspired by the success of the Wright brothers, Charles Kettering, an American military engineer from Ohio, proposed the idea of an unmanned aerial vehicle - essentially a bomb with wings. Thereby laying the foundation for the development of unmanned strike aviation.

According to the creator's idea, the aircraft stuffed with explosives was capable of flying in a straight line, without a pilot, for some time. Then the drone dropped its wings and fell on enemy positions. It is known that in 1914, Kettering received an order from the U.S. Army to produce such unmanned aircraft. A total of 45 units were produced. Later they were accepted for service, but they were never tested in combat.</p>

								<p>Radio-controlled ships got a new lease of life after the introduction of autopilots in the early 1930s.</p>
								<p>1935. Engineers of Great Britain create a reusable unmanned aerial vehicle. It was named "QeenBee". The model of Fairy Queen biplane was taken as the basis. After reconstruction and refinement, the drone could be controlled remotely from a seagoing vessel at a distance of up to 5 km. Its maximum horizontal flight speed was up to 170 km/hour. Receiving the code name DH82B, the model was used by the Royal Navy and British Air Force as a target for training firing until 1947.</p>

								<p>By the beginning of World War II radio-controlled unmanned objects were already in mass production. Especially the Target type. One of such UAVs was the famous QQ-2 radio plane. The first working model of which appeared in 1939. The QQ-2 radio plane was the most produced UAV. A total of 14,000 copies were produced.</p>

								<p>In conclusion, we note that even back then, there were people who believed in the benefits of technology and predicted the mass use of drones for peaceful purposes as well. However, at that time such thoughts were in the category of science fiction. Up until the beginning of the 21st century...

									<p>The use of drones is completely transforming the way crops are cultivated.

By adopting UAV technology, farmers and agricultural companies can increase yields, save time and find the best management solutions that will ensure their long-term success.

These days, farmers face many different factors that affect their well-being, including access to water, climate change, winds, soil quality, weeds and insects, changing growing seasons, and more.

All of this is pushing farmers to take advantage of high-tech drones that can cope with such challenges and ensure the most effective decisions are made as quickly as possible.

Agricultural drones provide farmers with access to a wealth of data that they can use to find the best management solutions, improve yields and overall profitability.

Drones can be used to collect data related to crop yields, livestock conditions, soil quality, nutrient levels, weather and precipitation forecasts, and more. Subsequently, the same data can be used to create detailed maps and make decisions based on verified information.

The agricultural industry does not neglect high-tech tools to optimize business operations. The use of drones in agriculture is the next step to help farmers and agricultural companies meet the changing demands of a growing market.</p>

									<p>The use of drones in agriculture is becoming more and more common.

Drones can help perform labor-intensive and complex tasks while reducing material costs.

We can expect the use of drones in agriculture to grow as the industry develops and new technologies are introduced.

Currently, there are 6 main ways to use agricultural drones:</p>

												</h4>

												<div class="panel-body">
													1. soil and field analysis
													At the beginning, middle and end of the crop cycle, you can use drones to obtain useful data on soil composition and quality. Using 3D soil maps, you can diagnose the presence of soil composition, nutrient levels or dead spots in a timely manner.

													This information can help farmers determine the most effective planting and growing patterns, soil care, etc. Ongoing monitoring can ensure that water resources are used optimally and that the proper nutrient ratios are maintained in the care of the plants.

													2. Seed planting.
													Seed planting by drone is a relatively recent practice and is not yet widespread, but some companies are experimenting by planting plant seeds using drones. Essentially, manufacturers are experimenting with specific systems that are programmed to spread seed into prepared soil.

													Young drone companies have been instrumental in developing unique technologies to solve a range of environmental and agricultural problems. For example, DroneSeed uses a drone capable of lifting a 57-pound payload/flight of tree seeds, herbicides, fertilizer and water for reforestation and replanting purposes.

													This technology helps minimize the need for a personal presence to plant in a selected area, which sometimes becomes a costly and energy-intensive task.

													This same drone technology can be adapted and applied to many types of farms, reducing planting time and labor costs.

													3. crop spraying and spot spraying
													Consistent fertilization and spraying is required to maintain rich crops. In the past, this was done manually by vehicle or airplane. However, these methods can be described as inefficient, burdensome and quite costly.

													Based on a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decision, drones can be equipped with large tanks that can be filled with fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides. Using drones to spray plants is much safer and more cost-effective. Drones are able to function autonomously and can be programmed to fly on a specific schedule and route.

													For example, if a fungus has been detected in some limited area, drones can be used to solve this problem. Given the speed of the drones, you have the opportunity to diagnose and eliminate a potential threat before it spreads throughout the farm.
													4. Crop mapping and surveying
													One of the main benefits of using drone technology is the ease and efficiency of large-scale monitoring of crops and farmland. In the past, satellite or airplane photos were used to obtain large-scale images of a farm and detect potential problems.

													However, these photos were expensive and could not guarantee the same degree of image accuracy that drones offer. These days, you can take not only real-time photos, but also chronologically aligned animations that show plant growth in real time.

													With drone mapping and surveying, technological decisions can now be made based on real-time data rather than outdated photos or practical considerations.

													With sensors taking near-infrared (NIR) images, you can determine plant health based on light absorption, instantly drawing an overall picture of a farm's well-being. We recently interviewed a drone pilot who used near-infrared spectrum photos to help vineyard owners diagnose the health of their vines.

													With agricultural drones, you can get information such as:

													Crop volume and plant health.
													Land distribution based on crop type.
													The current life cycle of the crop.
													Detailed maps of crop areas made with GPS.
													It's simple: with drones, land and resources can be maximized, helping farmers find the best areas to plant crops.

													5. Monitoring and organizing irrigation operations
													Irrigation is a hassle. If your irrigation systems stretch for miles, there's no escaping the hassle. Drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras can diagnose irrigation problems or areas with too little or too much moisture.

													With this information, you can create the most efficient planting patterns possible to improve drainage, use natural surface runoff, and avoid water accumulation that can damage sensitive crops.

													Water and irrigation system problems not only cost a lot of money, but can also destroy your crops. With drones, these problems will be detected before they can harm you.

													6. Real-time livestock monitoring
													Some drones are equipped with thermal imaging cameras that allow the pilot to control the drone and monitor livestock at the same time. This allows farmers to monitor livestock on a regular basis with minimal time and manpower

													The drone operator can quickly check the herd to make sure there are no wounded or missing animals, and that there are no young
